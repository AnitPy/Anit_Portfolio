# [Project 1: Telecom-Churn-Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/AnitPy/Telecom-Churn-Prediction)

The importance of this type of research in the telecom market is to help companies make more profit. It has become known that predicting churn is one of the most important sources of income to telecom companies. Hence, this research aimed to build a system that predicts the churn of customers in telecom company. These prediction models need to achieve high AUC values. To test and train the model, the sample data is divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing. We have applied feature engineering, effective feature transformation and selection approach to make the features ready for machine learning algorithms. In addition, we encountered another problem: the data was not balanced. This problem was solved by Oversampling or using trees algorithms not affected by this problem. These algorithms are Logistic Regression , Random Forest, KNN classifier , and XGBOOST algorithm.
# [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://anitpy.github.io/Anit_Portfolio/)
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
